Enabling Spring Boot Actuator
To enable Spring Boot actuator endpoints to your Spring Boot application, we need to add the Spring Boot Starter actuator dependency in our build configuration file.

Maven users can add the below dependency in your pom.xml file.

<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>


In the application.properties file, we need to disable the security for actuator endpoints.

management.security.enabled = false

YAML file users can add the following property in your application.yml file.

management:
   security:
      enabled: false
