JPA 

Spring Data repository interfaces

JPA Providers

JPA is an open source API, therefore various enterprise vendors such as Oracle, Redhat, Eclipse, etc.
provide new products by adding the JPA persistence flavor in them. 

Some of these products include: 
Hibernate, Eclipselink, Toplink, Spring Data JPA, etc.

Spring Data Repositories
Let's start with the JpaRepository â€“ which extends PagingAndSortingRepository and, in turn, the CrudRepository.

Each of these defines its own functionality:

CrudRepository provides CRUD functions
PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do pagination and sort records
JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch
And so, because of this inheritance relationship, the JpaRepository contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.
